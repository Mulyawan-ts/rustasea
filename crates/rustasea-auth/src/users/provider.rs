/// Async, write-capable user provider seam.
///
/// [`super::UserLookup`] is a synchronous, read-only credential resolver: it
/// is enough for the JWT/session guards' `login`, but it cannot create a user,
/// rotate a password hash, or flip `email_verified_at` — and it cannot await a
/// database round-trip. Registration, password reset, profile update, and
/// email verification all need to WRITE a user, and a database-backed login
/// needs to READ asynchronously. `UserProvider` is that seam.
///
/// # Relationship to `UserLookup`
///
/// `UserProvider` is deliberately **not** a supertrait of [`super::UserLookup`].
/// The two contracts serve different call sites (async DB writes vs. sync guard
/// reads), and forcing an async implementor to also satisfy the sync read
/// contract would leak an implementation detail. A type is free to implement
/// both — [`MemoryUserProvider`] does — but it is not required.
///
/// # Async convention
///
/// Every method returns a hand-rolled `Pin<Box<dyn Future<..> + Send>>` rather
/// than using `async fn` in the trait or `async_trait`, matching the crate's
/// existing [`crate::guard::Guard`] convention. This keeps the trait
/// object-safe (`&dyn UserProvider`) and `Send`.
///
/// # Fail-closed
///
/// The mutating methods have **no default implementation**: an implementor must
/// make an explicit choice for every write. [`DenyAllProvider`] is the
/// fail-closed default, mirroring [`super::StaticLookup`]'s posture.
///
/// # ORM adapter story
///
/// A database-backed implementation (e.g. over `rustasea-orm`) resolves each
/// call asynchronously inside its boxed future — `find_by_email` issues a
/// `SELECT`, `create` an `INSERT`, and so on. There is no pre-loading and no
/// feature gate: the async boundary is the trait itself, so the ORM adapter
/// returns its boxed query future directly. This crate stays DB-agnostic and
/// never depends on `sqlx`/`rustasea-orm`.
