//! Async model persistence — create/save/update/delete/refresh over a [`DbPool`].
//!
//! [`ModelOps`] is blanket-implemented for every [`Model`]. Column values are
//! taken from the model's `serde` representation, so the operations stay generic
//! across derived models; `created_at`/`updated_at` are populated on insert and
//! `updated_at` is refreshed on update, each rendered for the runtime dialect.
//! A timestamp the caller already supplied is preserved (Laravel's
//! `updateTimestamps` only fills a stamp that is not already set). Only the
//! `sqlx` runtime API is used — never the compile-time `query!` macros.
//!
//! The single-key path (one `id` column) and the composite-key path (a declared
//! [`Model::primary_key_columns`]) share this trait: `create`/`save`/`update`
//! dispatch on the key shape, while `delete`/`refresh` accept either a bare
//! `Uuid` (single key) or a `&[Value]` tuple (via the `*_by_key` variants).
