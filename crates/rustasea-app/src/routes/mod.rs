//! Route tables for the runnable `rustasea-app` binary.
//!
//! Concern-scoped tables mirror Laravel's `routes/{web,auth,settings,console}`
//! split (ADR-0002 decision 9). Each module registers its routes onto the
//! shared [`RouteTable`] via a `register(&mut RouteTable)` function; this
//! module merges them, registers the named middleware the tables declare, and
//! compiles the result into a dispatchable axum router.
//!
//! The workspace-root `routes/web.rs` is **not** compiled (see that file's
//! shim header); the canonical route definitions live here.
